# BLISS
Biometric Labeller and Image Segmentation Sandbox
This was a graphical utility I wrote to help segment and label biometric datasets.
The version posted here is obsolete. My face libraries are now based on the dlib face detection and landmark recognition combined with some custom deep nets implemented in keras/tensorflow. I'd like to integrate these new tools with BLISS but am currently short of spare time.

# Note: This code has only been tested under ubuntu 14.04
# Primary dependency is opencv version 2.4

First you'll need to run install.sh using:

sudo bash install.sh

To launch the gui, navigate into the BLISS subfolder and do:

python BLISS.pyw
